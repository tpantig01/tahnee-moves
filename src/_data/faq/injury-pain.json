  "question": "What if I have an old injury or chronic pain?",
  "answer": "Please let me know before class. I can provide modifications and alternative movements, but I'm not a physical therapist. If you're currently in acute pain or rehabbing an injury, get clearance from your healthcare provider first. That said, many people find that proper flexibility and strength work helps resolve chronic compensation patterns.",
