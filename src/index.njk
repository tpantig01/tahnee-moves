    <h2 class="section-title">My Approach</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 800px; margin-bottom: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
        Flexibility training isn't just about touching your toes. It's about understanding your body as an integrated system where science meets intuition, where breath unlocks what force cannot, and where emotional awareness transforms physical capability.
    </p>
    
    <div class="approach-grid">
        <div class="approach-card fade-in">
            <h3>Science Informed, Artistically Taught</h3>
            <p>Every technique is grounded in biomechanics and neuroscience, but delivered through flow, creativity, and personal expression. I translate research into movement that feels intuitive and empowering.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="approach-card fade-in">
            <h3>Warm Up & Assessment</h3>
            <p>We begin with intentional preparation, assessing your body's unique starting point each session. Your flexibility journey isn't linear, and neither is our approach to warming up your tissues and nervous system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="approach-card fade-in">
            <h3>Muscle Activation</h3>
            <p>Flexibility without strength is instability. I teach you to engage the right muscles at the right time, building active range of motion that your body trusts and can control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="approach-card fade-in">
            <h3>Breathing for the Parasympathetic Nervous System</h3>
            <p>Your breath is the bridge between conscious and unconscious control. Through targeted breathwork, we signal safety to your nervous system, allowing deeper release and access to range you didn't know you had.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="approach-card fade-in">
            <h3>Emotional Blocks & Visualization</h3>
            <p>The body keeps score. We explore how tension patterns connect to emotional holding, using visualization and somatic awareness to release what stretching alone cannot reach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="approach-card fade-in">
            <h3>Western & Eastern Medicine</h3>
            <p>I integrate anatomy and kinesiology with principles from yoga, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and somatic practices. The best of both worlds, honoring the whole person.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 style="font-family: 'Bebas Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.05em;">Plus: Hormonal Health Integration</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7;">Your flexibility isn't the same every day, and it shouldn't be. I teach you to work with your menstrual cycle, understanding how hormone fluctuations affect connective tissue, recovery capacity, and nervous system regulation. This is movement that truly moves WITH you.</p>

                <p>
                    Each class includes breathwork, targeted muscle activation, and progressive stretching protocols designed to create lasting change. Expect to leave understanding why certain stretches work and others don't.

                    Pole isn't just about tricks or aesthetics. It's a full-body strength and coordination practice that challenges you to move in three-dimensional space while building confidence and capability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this class, we start with grip techniques, basic spins, and foundational strength positions. Safety is paramount, but so is play. You'll learn proper form for pole-specific movements while discovering what your body can do when given the right progressions and support.

<section class="faq">
    <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">Do I need to be flexible to start?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Absolutely not. That's literally the point of taking a flexibility class. I work with complete beginners who can't touch their toes all the way to advanced practitioners working on specific skills. Every class includes modifications and progressions so you work at your appropriate level.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">What should I wear?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>For flexibility classes: comfortable athletic wear that allows full range of motion. For pole classes: shorts (skin grip is essential) and a fitted top. As you progress in pole, you'll want more skin exposed for better grip, but we start where you're comfortable.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">How often should I train?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>This depends on your goals and where you are in your cycle. Generally, 2-3 flexibility sessions per week creates steady progress. For pole, 1-2 times weekly is ideal for beginners. I teach you to listen to your body's signals and adjust frequency based on recovery, energy levels, and hormonal patterns.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">Will I get bulky from pole training?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. Pole builds functional strength and lean muscle that supports your body's movement capabilities. You'll develop defined arms, shoulders, and core strength, but "bulky" requires very specific training protocols, nutrition, and often genetic predisposition that pole training alone doesn't provide.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I do pole if I'm plus-size or not conventionally athletic?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. Pole is for every body. Different body types have different advantages in pole (longer limbs for extended shapes, shorter limbs for spins, etc.). Strength is gained through practice, not a prerequisite. My job is to meet you where you are and help you progress safely.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">How do you incorporate cycle syncing into classes?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>I provide guidance on when to push harder (follicular phase, when connective tissue is more resilient) and when to prioritize recovery and gentle work (luteal and menstrual phases). You'll learn to track your own patterns and adjust intensity accordingly. For those not cycling or on hormonal birth control, we focus on other biomarkers of readiness.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">What if I have an old injury or chronic pain?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Please let me know before class. I can provide modifications and alternative movements, but I'm not a physical therapist. If you're currently in acute pain or rehabbing an injury, get clearance from your healthcare provider first. That said, many people find that proper flexibility and strength work helps resolve chronic compensation patterns.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
            <div class="faq-question">Is there a community aspect or is it just classes?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Movement is better together. While classes are the core offering, I'm building a community of people who value functional transformation and evidence-based training. Expect opportunities for workshops, shared progress tracking, and connection with others on similar journeys.</p>
